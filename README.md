# Malaria-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning project aimed at diagnosing malaria from cell images. Utilizing the publicly available NIH Malaria Dataset, the project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to differentiate between parasitized and uninfected blood smear slides.

**Project Overview:**

**Dataset:** NIH Malaria Dataset featuring thin blood smear slide images stained with Giemsa, highlighting cellular structures. 

**Objective:** Develop a reliable CNN model that can automatically and accurately identify and classify parasitized and uninfected cells.

**Preprocessing:** Includes resizing images, applying data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization, and normalization to handle variations in image staining.

**Model Architecture:** Designed with multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activations, pooling layers, and dropout for regularization, culminating in a softmax output layer for binary classification.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Focus on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance effectively.

**Key Findings:**
- The implemented CNN model demonstrates high accuracy and reliability, suitable for aiding malaria diagnostics in clinical settings.
- Data augmentation significantly improved model robustness against overfitting, ensuring better generalization on unseen data.
- Hyperparameter tuning was crucial in optimizing the model's performance, balancing the trade-off between computation cost and diagnostic accuracy.

**Potential Applications:**
The model can be integrated into healthcare systems for rapid screening of malaria, especially in regions with limited access to expert microscopic analysis.
Further development and validation of the model could lead to widespread adoption in telemedicine applications, providing support in remote or understaffed medical facilities.

This repository provides all code and documentation needed to replicate the study, offering insights into both the practical and theoretical aspects of using machine learning in medical image analysis.
