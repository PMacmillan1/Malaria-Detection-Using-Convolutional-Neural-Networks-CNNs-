# Malaria-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning project aimed at diagnosing malaria from cell images. Utilizing the publicly available NIH Malaria Dataset, the project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to differentiate between parasitized and uninfected blood smear slides.
